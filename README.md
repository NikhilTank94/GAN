# Generative-Adversarial-Network---GAN

Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a class of machine learning framework originally designed as a type of generative model for unsupervised learning by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. The approach work by taking noise as an input parameter and generate candidates using “Generative Network”, which is evaluated by “Discriminative network” for its originality in comparison to the real image from the training dataset. A good model will procedure novel candidates that the discriminator thinks are not synthesized (meaning to “fool” the system that the candidate is from the true data distribution instead of fake or synthesized). The network works by fine-tuning both the Generator and Discriminator over each epoch (iteration) and each works towards improving each other’s performance. Since the two networks are always fighting against each other, that’s why they can be called adversaries, because of this they are termed as “Generative Adversarial Network”. The model generates handwritten number digits on it own using the learning made from MNIST database.
